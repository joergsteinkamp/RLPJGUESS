LPJ-GUESS is a dynamic global vegetation model (DGVM) available on request at: http://www.nateko.lu.se/lpj-guess

This R package simplifies the usage and visualisation of LPJ-GUESS ascii output for use in R (at least for me). You can read the LPJ-GUESS *.out files and creates data.frames of them, p.e.

* timeseries (either ts or zoo)
* spatial data frames

These data.frames can be visualized with ggplot2 functions. It also includes some templates for ggplot2 themes. For pretty plotting a world border dataset is used (available at http://thematicmapping.org/downloads/world_borders.php) using the following code:

require(ggplot2)
require(maptools)
worldmap <- readShapeSpatial("TM_WORLD_BORDERS-0.3.shp")
worldmap <- fortify(worldmap)
save(worldmap, file="worldmap.RData", compress="xz")

Of course you could write everything yourself, but why reinventing the wheel?

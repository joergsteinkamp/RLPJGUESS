This simplifies the usage and visualisation of LPJ-GUESS ascii output for use in R (al least for me). You can read the LPJ-GUESS *.out files and creates data.frames of them, p.e.

* timeseries (either ts or zoo)
* spatial data frames

These data.frames can be visualized with ggplot2 functions. It also includes some templates for ggplot2 themes. For pretty plotting a World border dataset is used (available at http://thematicmapping.org/downloads/world_borders.php) using the following code:

require(ggplot2)
require(maptools)
worldmap <- readShapeSpatial("/data/external/global/Political/worldborders/TM_WORLD_BORDERS-0.3.shp")
worldmap <- fortify(worldmap)
save(worldmap, file="~/lib/R/LPJ/data/worldmap.RData", compress=TRUE)

Of course you could write everything yourself, but why reinventing the wheel?
